# SQL-database
During my first year of my City, University of London studies, I completed an SQL database (attached as a Virtual Studio code document in this repository) as an assessment for the databases module. I was able to be creative in this assessment by incorporating my love for K-pop (South Korean pop music) by creating a database and using a rich variety of queries for a website that allows users to purchase K-pop related items, such as concert tickets. I was graded 98 marks out of 100 for this database.
