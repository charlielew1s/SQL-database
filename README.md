# SQL-database
During my first year of my City, University of London studies, I completed an SQL database attached in this repository as an assessment for my university's Databases module. 

My love of K-pop (South Korean pop music) was incorporated into this assessment task. I created a database for a web - based company that I made up called K-pop Treasure Chest (KTC). This company developed an online platform which provides the latest news and information about K-pop idol groups and songs, whilst also enabling the purchasing of K-pop concert tickets. 

For this task, I developed a rich variety of SQL statements and queries and was graded of 98/100. This assignment in addition to helping me develop my skills writing SQL also enabled me to understand and appreciate the real life application of my studies.
